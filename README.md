# CRMFT Data Visualisations Insights and Findings

BRAC UPG project is aimed towards financially helping those in poverty. The dataset was a collection of households, living conditions and tenant information.
My aim was to take this dataset, preprocess it and gain helpful insights that would be clean and presentable.

## Libraries used:
Pandas
Numpy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Plotly

##Preprocessing

The data is first cleaned through:

1. Renaming Columns for spelling errors
2. Dataframes are created after slicing the main file
3. sectioned and visualised
   
## How to use this 
Should you choose to use this, you can download the ipynb, feed your own dataset and use it to gain insights.
